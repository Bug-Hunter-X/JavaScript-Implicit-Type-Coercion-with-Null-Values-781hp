This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving implicit type coercion with null values. The bug.js file showcases the issue, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from using loose equality (==) when comparing with null, leading to unexpected results in certain cases.  The solution uses strict equality (===) to avoid type coercion issues.
